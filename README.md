# Mail Server System

The system is an email sending application that allows users to send emails through real-world mail services (such as Gmail, Outlook) using SMTP, or send emails locally between accounts within the system.You can also send files or attachments with the emails.

On the server side, the system can manage users, handle sent and received emails, and generate reports such as the total number of emails sent, the top senders, and the proportion of emails sent via SMTP versus local delivery.
